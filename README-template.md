## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it.

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

### What I learned

- [CSS Variablen vs. SASS Variablen](https://codyhouse.co/blog/post/css-custom-properties-vs-sass-variables). CSS Variablen lassen sich irgendwie einfacher √ºber mehrere Dateien hinweg verwenden. Bei SASS Vars. m√ºssen diese immer erst import werden. Erscheint mir dann √ºberfl√ºssig. Dass man mit CSS Vars wohl flexibler ist und diese einfacher √ºberschreiben kann
- SASS Dateistruktur 5-1 vs. 7-1 usw. Was geh√∂rt in "Abstracts" und was in "Base" noch keine Strategie.
- SASS Partials, @use und @forward
- REM vs. EM: [Use `rem` for Global Sizing; Use `em` for Local Sizing](https://css-tricks.com/rem-global-em-local/)
- Summary: em units for the font-size property will be relative to the font-size of the parent element. em units on other properties than font-size will be relative to the font-size of the current element. rem units sizes will always be relative to the font-size of the root html element. r = root (Merkhilfe) [Quelle](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/css-rem-vs-em-units)
- https://piccalil.li/tutorial/fluid-typography-with-css-clamp/
- em shines when the behavior of spacing relative to the element is the desired effect. [Quelle](https://moderncss.dev/generating-font-size-css-rules-and-creating-a-fluid-type-scale/)
  To see how you can add code snippets, see below:
- Best practices f√ºr den Umgang mit Bildern. [Performance vs. Design](https://css-tricks.com/a-guide-to-the-responsive-images-syntax-in-html/)
- [Fluid Type & Space](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2021/04/designing-developing-fluid-type-space-scales/)
- N√§chstes Projekt: erst Fluid Type & Space definieren. Spacings als Komponenten in Figma anlegen. Damit Designs erstellen. Dann grobe Struktur (rudiment√§re Klassen vs. BEM) in HTMl erstellen und progressiv verbessern.
- Responsive Images und [Art Direction](https://css-tricks.com/a-guide-to-the-responsive-images-syntax-in-html/#art-direction-can-do-a-lot-more-than-just-cropping)

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```

```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('üéâ');
};
```
